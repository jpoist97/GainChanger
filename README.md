## Overview
Gainchanger is a student project thats main motivation was to create a product that we would use. During this time, we noticed that the workout apps that already exist were cramped, costly, and hard to use. After weeks of user-research, planning, prototyping and competitor analysis; we set out to improve the workout app experience and create the best workout app on the market. With that goal in mind, we created an easy to use app allows for users to create workouts, combine these workouts into cycles, view their workout history, access graphs that show overall progress, and a bunch of other features. 

### Vision Statement
We strive to help gym-goers and athletes plan, organize, and track their workouts so that they can easily see their progress and motivate them to reach new personal records!
